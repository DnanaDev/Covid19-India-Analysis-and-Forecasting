# Mentorskool Community Projects - COVID-19

**Hi There!**

Mentorskool welcomes you all to this exciting new project!

### What's this project all about?
The year 2020 has brought itself one of the worst pandemics in the world history. The coronavirus which started off in Wuhan, China has now spread across the world and caused more than 3.5 million active cases as on today. While the entire Europe and US has been ravaged by the invisible enemy, India has been fighting this really hard and has made all attempts possible to control the spread and test people enough to objectively assess the possibility of a community spread. <br>

Data Science offers great promise towards answering some of the pertinent questions asked by the Govt. as well as people related to this unforeseen pandemic. Can we as Data Scientists help them get answers to some of them like the one below?

* Which are the most affected States?
* Which states have been able to successfully control the spread?
* What is the rate of spread across States?
* Is the current rate of testing sufficient?
* Which states should focus on rapidly increasing the testing rate?
* Are older people more vulnerable to the disease?
* Does the disease spread faster in men compared to women?
* What % of affected patients had a travel history against in-house?

And the possibilites are just endless!!

-----------------

### Tasks you'll do
* Collate data from multiple public sources to develop an extensive base dataset to help answer most of the questions asked above
* Perform Data Modelling to develop  data dictionaries and ER diagrams to replicate a COVID Analysis data set up
* Regular data pre-processing and wrangling
* Working with structured (Tables, CSV), Unstructured (Free text) data using Python
* Design and implement different types of databases (ex. Relational or NoSQL) as per the demands of structure of data
* Perform extensive exploratory data analysis using SQL and/or Python
* Apply time series techniques to perform disease count predictions
* Host, Manage and work with data on cloud platforms like Azure and AWS
* Statistical analysis
	* Uni-variate
	* Bi-variate
	* Tests of significance
	* Distributions
* Visualization (Both Python based and Power BI/Tableau based)
* Clustering of patients based on their attributes to try and see any meaningful group formation etc.

-----------------

### Skills you'll learn 
* Visualization in Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
* Visualization in Power BI/Tableau
* Data Modelling
* Implementing a Logical schema into an actual database (Relational/NoSQL)
* Data Mining with SQL/Python
* Statistical analysis with Python (scipy)

---------------------------

### Project Outcomes
* Project storybook developed in the form of a Google Colab notebook
* Video summary of your project
* Your own website created as GitHub pages

---------------------------

### How to get started?
* Quite simple! Follow the steps mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/mentorskool/Welcome/blob/master/docs/Setting%20up%20your%20project.pdf" target="_blank">**this**</a> document to setup your project
