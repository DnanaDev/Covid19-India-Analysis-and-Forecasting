```
# got the json data but it is not very readable
# print(source)
# print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
# data in the format of ['cases_time_series'] with objects for each day nested in it. ['key_values']
# another key/object in it of the form ['statewise']
# Lets read cases time-series
# "dailydeceased": "0",
# "dailyrecovered": "0",
# "date": "30 January ",
# "totalconfirmed": "1",
# "totaldeceased": "0",
# "totalrecovered": "0"
# print(json.dumps(data['cases_time_series'], indent = 2))
